They ask her, \"Who pussy's this?\" Look her right in her eyes.  She say, \"This pussy's yours, Daddy\" Tell 'em nothin but lies. Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to. Needed to.

Sylvester and Twan get in a car; Sylvester says, \"Man, first of all, straighten yo hat. Now, man, I'm about to go holla at somebody, and I'mma need you to watch my back.\" Then Twan says, \"Man, you ain't even gotta worry 'bout me, bra-lou, I'm straight.\" Sylvester says, \"Yeah, you straight, a'ight, witcha hot-headed ass, nigga, just like when you caught that case.\" Twan says, \"Aw, here we go, you bringin' that shit up. That wasn't shit but a misdemeanor.\" Sylvester says, \"Misdemeanor, my ass. You did three years.\" Twan says, \"Yeah, that was because of Roxanne and that bitch, Tina.\"  \"Man...yo sister asked me about a Tina.\" Twan says, \"When I see her, I'mma kill her. What did Gwen ask you?\" \"She asked me if I knew her; I said she sound familiar.\" Sylvester says, \"Hold up. Man, what you doin'?\" And then Twan says, \"Man, what you mean?\" Then Sylvester says, \"Man, is that a cigarette?\" Twan says, \"Man, nah. This some weed.\" Sylvester pulled (Whoo) over, sayin', \"Aw, HELL naw.\" \"Nigga, what the--?\" \"You forget where we are?\" Twan say, \"One for the road.\" Sylvester say, \"You crazier than a fish with titties if you think I'mma let you smoke that shit up in my car. Now throw that shit out.\" Twan looks at Sylvester like he ain't tryin' to hear that Sylvester says, \"Throw that shit out.\" Twan looks around and say, \"Shit,\" and throws it out  They pull off and Sylvester says, \"Now this Roxanne and Tina, man, what's that all about?\" Now, while they talk about that, let's head on over to Rosie the nosy neighbor's house She's peekin' out her window, sayin', \"There's somethin' goin' on over there with Bernadine and Ted.\" Then her husband turns over and says, \"Woman, what's wrong with you? Bring yo old, nosy ass back to bed.\" She says, \"Now, Randolph, I don't like that tone you takin' with me.\" He says, \"Oh, shut up, woman; you always invokin', get on folk, they privacy.\" Rosie says, \"I can look out my God-damned window whenever I want.\" Randolph say, \"Yeah?

Yo hat.\" \"Oh, my bad.\" \"Gimme a light.\" (The lighter is handed over) \"Now, when we pull up, you keep the car in drive and whatever you do, keep on watchin'.\" \"Man, like I said before, don't trip, bra-lau, go handle yo business.\"  \"Now, I'm about to see if I can get this bitch to talk to me. We made a deal and she owes me some money.\" \"Man, I feel you, G, so call me if you need me.\" \"Man, everything should go smooth.\" \"Sylvester, don't make me have to come up in there and smack me a couple of--\" (Time goes by...) It's thirty minutes later (Time goes by...) Forty-five minutes later (Time goes by...) And now one hour later...&lt;","A car pulls up to a restaurant The door opens and someone gets out First thing you see is some heels and a dress Black shades on scarf around her head and mouth Who could it be? Why are they here? Up the stairs they're goin' Through the door, down the aisle Like she's walkin' in slow motion  Checkin' out the place And she walks lookin' real cool Peepin' out through her glasses Before she sits in the booth She goes in her purse; pull a cigarette out Puts it in her mouth; he lights it Then she blows smoke, pause for a minute And says, \"What the hell happened?!\"  \"First of all, woman, keep your voice down. I ain't tryin' to get loud up in here. Second of all, how was I 'posed to know That your husband was a fuckin' queer?\" \"Shh!\" The waitress walks by She says, \"I'll be with y'all in a minute.\"  \"Now, we made a deal. The plan was for me To come home with you. Girl, I did my part. So don't you go askin' me what the hell happened When I didn't wanna do this shit from the start.\" And then she said, \"Yeah, right. You didn't wanna do this shit, but yo ass got paid.\" And then she said, \"Sylvester--\" I said, \"Hold up, bitch. Are you crazy? Don't be sayin' my name.\"  She said, \"Whatever. How come you didn't tell me You was married to Gwen?\" \"First of all, between the fake wigs and fake names, How the hell I'm supposed to know that Gwen is yo friend, bitch?\" \"Shh! Here comes the waitress again.\"  \"Sorry I kept y'all waiting. Child, this place is busy. It's always crowded about this time. Can I start y'all off with something to drink?\" I said, \"I'll just have a coffee With two sugars, light on the cream.\" She said, \"Vodka, straight up. Hell...Shit, I need a drink.\"  Then the waitress said, \"Girl, I heard that. I'll be right back with your drinks.\" And then she walks away ; I look back at her And says, \"She looked familiar to me...\" Then she says, \"What?\" I say, \"Nothin'. It's just a thought. Anyway, girl, I thought the plan was for me To be in that house with you and get caught?\"  She says, \"It was.\" I said, \"What ha--?\" She said, \"I changed my mind.\" I blew smoke, then I put my cigar out Said, \"I'm out this motherfucker, 'cause you wastin' my time.\" She says, \"Wait, don't go.\" \"Well, then, god-damn it, talk to me.\" She says, \"You wouldn't understand...\" [starts crying] \"...Try me.\" [crying] \"Cathy?\" \"Yes?\" \"Try me.\" She blows her nose and says,  \"Well, it all started one night When I was sittin' in the livin' room, And sounds like I could hear somebody In the bedroom, moanin' and groanin', And I knew it wasn't me, So my curiosity Led me to believe That he was cheatin' on me.\"  \"Well, how come you just didn't ask him? Give him the benefit of the doubt?\" \"Because a woman knows. A woman just knows when some shit is foul.\" And then I said, \"Calm down. Here comes the waitress.\" \"Mmm, like I said, it's busy around this time, But thank y'all for bein' patient.\" Said, \"Can I get y'all anything else?\" I said, \"No, that'll be all.\" Then Cathy says, \"Sylvester--\" He says, \"Hold on,\" 'Cause he's gettin' another phone call  It's Twan sayin, \"Everything a'ight?\" Then Sylvester says, \"We workin' it out.\" Then Twan says, \"Well, call me if you need me, dawg. You know I'm holdin' you down.\" And I said,\"No doubt.\" I hang up, then Cathy says, \"Well, lemme get back to tellin' you what went wrong. Where was I? Oh, yeah, The day I heard him arguing on the phone.\"  Now the story goes on and on And she tellin' him everything that happened While Twan's outside in the car Radio on, boppin' his head, just rappin' Sylvester said, \"Girl, are you sayin' he was havin' sex With another man on the phone?\" She says, \"Yes.\" I say, \"I can't talk about this.\" She says, \"Why?\" I say, \"'Cause this shit is getting uncomfortable.\"  Now, back to Twan; he turns the radio down 'Cause he gets a call He says, \"Yeah, what up?\" And a voice says,\"Yo, G, I got that information on Tina.\" He says, \"Talk to me, dawg.\" \"Well, the word out on the street is the bitch has stopped hoein'; Doin' head outta her mama's basement and got a job.\" [chuckles] \"Ha-ha is right. The day that bitch stop hoein' Is the day they stop sellin' dots. (\"Heh-heh.\") You feel me, Joe?\" \"Word.\" \"Where the bitch work at, a candy store?\" \"Naw, the job that she got's supposed to be legit. I heard your girl all found some ol' waitress shit.\" \"Yeah? Waitress, where?\" \"Hold on, I'm waitin' on my people to hit me; Roxanne and T own the place.\" \"You shittin' me. Where this place at?\" He says, \"Hold up, I'm gettin' a phone call.\"  Now, meanwhile, Sylvester's askin' Cathy, \"Well, why you still love him?\" Then Cathy says, \"When I saw Chuck, I just couldn't lose him to him.\" And then the waitress comes again But this time she brings the bill Slides her a $50, says, \"Keep the change.\" She says, \"Damn, thanks. Shit, y'all, keep it real.\"  And meanwhile, outside in the car, Twan's getting impatient; his homie comes back to the phone Twan says, \"Do I look like En Vogue? He says, \"Why?\" Says, \"Nigga, 'cause the way you got me holdin' on.\" \"I gotcha, dawg. I got where the bitch work, live, information and all.\" \"Yeah. Nigga, I'm listenin'.\" \"Well, nigga, first of all, You gotta keep me down, 'cause I went through a lotta crazy shit to find her.\" \"Yeah, whatever, I got you.\" \"Moved in with some nigga in the Jeffrey Manor, It's 'round the corner, it's a place called Shay-Shay's Diner.\" \"Nigga, you forget I just did three years. I need the exact address to where this place is.\" \"My bad, you right, kid. 9501, that's right off Hallstid.\" Pause it right there Now shoot back into the restaurant real quick  Sylvester looks up at the waitress and says, \"Excuse me, but it seems like I know you.\" And at the same time, Twan's in the car, going, \"Man, this address sounds familiar...\" Meanwhile, in the restaurant, the waitress blows a bubble and says, \"Where you know me from?\" Twan's homie gives him the name of the place again He looks up at the sign and says, \"What the fuck...?\" And meanwhile, back in the restaurant, Cathy's nudgin' me under the table, goin', \"Sylvester...\" And Sylvester looks at the name tag on her shirt And noticed that shit says, \"Tina\"  Then, the waitress starts backin' up With this confused look on her face While Twan's outside on the phone, tellin' his homie, \"Man, I'm right outside of the fuckin' place!\" Then Sylvester says, \"Hold up. I just wanna talk to you for a minute.\" Then she starts screamin' Roxanne's name real loud (Roxanne! Roxanne!) This bitch comes runnin' from the back with a skillet Then Tina breaks a beer bottle on the table And says, \"Nigga, I will cut you with this glass!\" Cathy walks by me, goin' out the door, sayin', \"Not tryin' to get loud in here, my ass!\" Tina starts warmin' around Sylvester, sayin', \"We take Tae Bo classes!\" Then Twan runs up in the place and says, \"I will kill both of y'all knucklehead asses!\" ([Echoing] Asses!...asses!...asses...asses...)&lt;","\"Well, well, well. If it ain't Laverne and Shirley.\" Tina says, \"Hey, Twan.\" Twan says,  \"Bitch, don't 'Hey, Twan' me.\" Sylvester says, \"Calm down, T.\" He says, \"Fuck that; I just did three years for these hos.\" Roxanne says, \"Who you callin' a ho?!\" He says, \"You, bitch!\" She lost control and said, \"Motherfucker, I'll kill yo ass!\"  \"Stop--\" \"What?!\" (\"Wait a minute.\")\"Come on!!\" \"With a skillet?\" (\"Let's talk about it.\") \"Damned right!\" \"Bitch, I--\"(\"Before some-motherfuckin'-body gets hurt.\") \"Jump, nigga!\" \"Man--\" (\"T, stop--\") \"Fuck that!\" \"Wait a minute! Nigga, think about it!\" \"Three years!!\" \"Three years; this time'll be worse! Now come here.\"  Sylvester takes Twan to the side Tina tells Roxanne to calm down Then Sylvester says to Twan, \"Look...Now, I know you mad, But before you go around here makin' threats, Nigga, let's not forget the fact that you're out, But you're still on house arrest.\"  Then Twan says, \"Cool, man. I just wanna ask them Some questions about what happened.\" Sylvester said, \"I feel you, but calm yo ass down, Or nigga, you goin' back in.\" Twan says, \"I got you.\" \"House arrest!\" \"I got you, I got you.\" \"T... Chill...\" Then Twan walks over to them and says,  \"How you doin', ladies? Tina, Roxanne, please excuse me. I mean, where's my manners? 'Cause, uh, that was very rude of me.\" \"Twan--\" \"Naw, I admit The way I came up in here, man, it was kinda wild. But that ain't shit compared to the way things gonna go (\"Twan--\") If THESE bitches don't tell me what went down!\"  (\"Yeah, nigga!\") \"Listen, motherfucker, slow your roll! Calm down, nigga; stop this shit!\" (\"Come on!\") \"Sylvester, fuck that! All because of these bitches, My ass got set up on a three-year bid!\" (\"Come on, motherfucker!\") \"What you gonna do, nigga, kill these bitches?!\" \"Yeah!\" \"And then what?! Then what?! LIFE, nigga! They'll lock yo ass up and throw away the key.\"  Then Twan starts thinkin' about it While Tina and Roxanne's watchin' him And I say, \"Man, forget about it.\" He says, \"No.\" I say, \"Well, let me talk to them.\" He say, \"They slick-ass, man, you can't trust 'em.\" \"Nigga, it ain't about me trustin' them, It's about you trustin' me right now.\"  \"Nigga, what's wrong with you? Are you crazy? You forgot I did five years in the pen myself. Now, I'm tellin' you, I'm not goin' back for you, these bitches, or no-motherfuckin'-body else. So lemme talk to 'em. I got this.\" Sylvester takes out his gun and shows it to the ladies, Walks up to 'em and says,  \"Now, ladies.\" He takes the cigarette out of Roxanne's ear And says, \"Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies.\" He walks over to the counter and sits down He puts the gun on the counter, goes into his pocket And pull a cigarette lighter out And then he lights the cigarette Blows smoke, and then says,  \"Now, ladies, it's very obvious That we have a problem here. A lot of questions unanswered. Let's answer them so we can get out of here. Mmm... [blows smoke] Safe, that is.\" He flicks the ashes and says, \"OK. Which one of y'all gonna start talkin' first?\"  Then Tina start cryin', sayin', \"It was supposed to be a simple operation.\" And Roxanne said, \"If we delivered, Muscle Man here said it would be a vacation.\" Twan says, \"Man, I'll show you a vacation; (\"Twan--\") I'll send y'all ass straight to the motherfuckin' moon!\" \"Twan! What did I tell you? Ladies, continue.\"  Then Roxanne said, \"On the way to Atlanta, everything was goin' smooth, Up until Twan start smokin' trees And actin' like a fool. (\"What are you doin'?\") And that's real. He got the radio loud, Bumpin' Mary Jane, just swervin' and shit.\" \"Did you tell him to stop?\" \"Yeah, I told him to stop, (\"Stop!\") But he just kept yelling out to me, \"Nah, I'm Rick James, bitch!\"  Sylvester looks at Twan Twan says, \"Man, I was drunk!\" Sylvester said, \"Drunk?! You was drunk?!\" Twan says, \"Man, I don't know; I was just tryin' to have a little fun.\" \"With a whole lotta heat in the trunk?! Man, I'm disgusted. Nigga, no wonder yo ass got busted.\"  Then Twan says, \"Man, whose side Are you on anyway?! Theirs?!\" Then Sylvester said, \"Well, let's see...Reckless endangerment, Loud music with drugs in the trunk? Nigga, yeah!\" Twan say, \"Man, this some bullshit!\" Roxanne says, \"Can I finish?!\" \"Please,\" Sylvester says She says, \"Well, to make a long story short--\"  Tina says, \"Roxanne, Girl, let me explain. See, Twan was kinda actin' wild And callin us all loud names. Then Roxanne starts cursin' and screamin'. Meanwhile I'm in the backseat, And all I know is I looked behind me. I said, 'Oh, shit! Here comes the police!'\"  Roxanne said, \"Next thing you know, Twan started speedin', Yellin' out, 'They ain't gonna stop us!'\" Tina says, \"A few minutes later, here come these squad cars And a fuckin' helicopter.\" Sylvester said, \"Did he stop then?\" Tina says, \"No.\" Roxanne says, \"But luckily, that raggedy-ass car he was drivin' Stopped on us, or we'd be who knows.\"  Then Roxanne says, \"Anyway, here we are, The Three fuckin' Stooges laid out in the dirt. Now they puttin' us in the back of the car, Twan yellin' out, 'Whatever y'all do, don't say a fuckin' word!' And now we at the police station. They got us separated off up in these rooms. Yellin' all in our ears, sayin', 'Yo man try and say these drugs belonged to you.'  And I'm like, 'What the fuck?!' They say, 'Sister, yo light is lookin' kinda dim.' I looked up at Tina and said, 'Girl, I'm not goin' down, not for him!' So there you have it, Twan. I gave you up; it was me. Tina, she protected you.\" Twan said, \"Protected me for what?!\" Tina said, \"'Cause at the time, I was pregnant by you, T...\" [Sylvester coughs]&lt;","\"Mmm...

Let's go.\"  Sylvester says, \"Wait a minute.\" Twan says, \"Bye.\" Sylvester says, \"Twan.\" \"Shit, see you.\" They both paused, turned around, Tina looked at Twan and says, \"In court, motherfucker, wouldn't wanna be you!\" Sylvester says, \"Twan! Ladies, please. Wait a minute. Don't go yet.\" Twan say, \"They need to learn some respect.\" I say, \"Twan.\" He says, \"Holla.\" Roxanne say, \"Nigga, she gonna holla at that child support check.\"  Sylvester's saying, \"Nobody goin' nowhere. Now, y'all resolve this so we can put this shit in the past.\" Roxanne say, \"Cool. We'll talk to you, But we ain't got shit to say to his old, Shrek-lookin' ass.\" T say, \"Man, who this fever-blister-lookin' bitch Think she talkin' to?\" \"T--\" She says, \"You, motherfucker!\" I said, \"Damn, baby, calm down!\" Roxanne says, \"What?! What you gonna do?!\"  Tina starts to blink her eye again But this time, even faster than before And the she cries out real loud and says, \"I can't take this shit no more!\" Then Sylvester asks Roxanne, \"What's wrong with your girl's eye? It's like it keep flinchin'.\" She say, \"A year ago, a pimp hit her in the eye, And ever since then, she's got this nervous condition.\"  Then Twan develops a soft spot and says, \"Sylvester, come here and let me holla.\" Twan pulls him to the side and says, \"Man, what you think?\" He says, \"What you mean?\" He says, \"Am I that baby's father?\" Then Sylvester says, \"I don't know. It's hard to tell, Especially when you was in the pen. But there's one thing I do believe and that is, Is that the bitch didn't turn you in.\"  Then Twan start walkin' around, sayin', \"Man, I don't know. A nigga feelin' kinda strange.\" Then Sylvester says, \"Gwen told me, dawg, That you was thinkin' about makin' a change.\" Roxanne yell out, \"I gotta lock this place up, And y'all two got to go.\" Sylvester say, \"What time do this place close?\" She says, \"80 points is gone.\" He says, \"Well, act like it's a quarter to four!\"  Then he says, \"Talk to the girl, Twan.

I just started laughing. Shaking my head. And just kept on laughing. Thinking about all the things I had been through that day. Then cries what why do you have that smile upon your face. Then I laughed out said thinking about the things that I've been through. She wipes her nose and she sniggles and laughs out I've been through it too. Then I start laughing again. And she start laughing more. Then next thing you know we both are cracking up on the floor. She laughs I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone. Now meanwhile Twan just got out of prison and he's on his way home. Then she laughs baby I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bullshit. Then I say girl just wait till I tell you all the drama that I've been dealing wit. She laughs I wanna hear it all. Then I laugh and say baby first of all. I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet, slept wit who knows, threatened to kill a pastor. She says what. Baby this is no lie he had a lover turns out to be a gay guy. She says damn you've been through a lot. Plus I gotta ticket. Meanwhile the policeman he turns around. Just out of concern comes back to the house. Then he pulls up in the driveway. My cars parked crooked with the lights on. Then he goes around the back way. He hear the dogs barking like somethings wrong. He gets to the backdoor and discover its been broken in. He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in. Meanwhile were laughing and laughing and laughing. But from his perspective he thinks somebodies crying. He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing. Meanwhile were in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain. She yells out Sylvester your killing me. Said I swear that it went that way. Then next thing you know he bust up in the room said muthafucka freeze. And then I looked back up at him and said wait your that damn police. Then she screams baby, I mean James she says everything is cool. And then he yells Gwendolyn I got this. I know your sick and tired off this fool. Then I stood up start walking toward him screaming man get out my house. Then he yells freeze she scream please and i pulled my barretta out. She cried out Sylvester please don't. Visions of him making love to her. He said man put the gun on the floor. I can't stop thinking about him and her. I slowly put the gun and then I put my hands up. He winked at me and smiled. And that is when I went nuts. Hopped all over him grabbed the gun. She screaming settle down. Going all around both handling the gun then all of a sudden POW.&lt;","There's total silence, blood everywhere And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin' screamin' \"What did you do?\" And then the policeman looks at me and screams \"See, now I warned you.\" Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' \"God, what have we done here?!\" And she rushed to to door, blood on her hands screamin' \"There goes your whole career.\" Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin' \"We gotta do somethin' and gotta do somethin' quick.\" Then he picks up the gun and says \"I have a wife at home, I can't have no cause of this.\" She says \"James, I can't believe you just said what you said. Cause that's not what you said when your ass was in my bed.\" Then I said \"Gettin' married later, but right now we gotta use our heads. First of all, did anybody check if the man was alive or dead.\" Then he looks at her, she looks at me, I look at them and we look at him.  Meanwhile, Gwen's about to have a nervous breakdown the way she's shakin' and cryin' And then she screams \"You bastards! You've killed my brother.\" And then I said \"Gwen, wait a minute, I didnt...\" She says \"No, you killed my brother.\" She said \"He just got out of prison. He's been through a lot. He was talking about changin' his life and everything and to come home and get shot Then I said \"Baby, it wasn't my fault. This man had a gun on me. And besides, how was I to know that you was getting down with this crooked ass police.\" And he says \"Wait a minute...\" I say \"No, you wait a minute!\" And then I say \"Man, this is my wife. We had a life until you butted up in it.\" She cried out \"Sylvester, now hold on. Even though he was in our home, let's not forget the fact that you was out there creepin' in another man's home.\" *Cough cough* *cough cough*  Twan starts coughin'. *cough cough* She says \"Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you okay ?\" He looks up at her and says \"I'm not gonna die, at least not today.\" And then he asks what happened and says \"Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is this policeman doin' here ?\" And I said \"Go on, tell him cop.\" He says \"Son, we gotta get you to a hospital and take a look at that wound.\" Twan says \"No, I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. All I need is a bathroom.\" Now five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan says \"Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison.\" And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like \"Oh no! Here we go again!\" Thinkin' out loud to myself sayin' \"When is this shit gonna end ?!\" Then Gwendolyn looks at me and says \"Baby, you got that?\" And I say \"NO!\" She says \"Why?\" And i said \"Because I'm not openin' up another motherfuckin' door!\" And the cop says \"Gwen, I'll get it.\" Then looks at me and says \"Man of the house, my ass!\" Then I say \"I'll get it, but whoever it is, I'm about to put their ass on blast!\" And then, the policeman grabbed me. I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor Then Twan says \"Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point that shit toward the door! \" Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says \"Officer, arrest me later.\" I count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rose the nosy neighbor... Ooh, with a spatula in her hand  Like that's gon do something against them guns It's Rosy the nosy...whoa Neighbor....&lt;","The policeman gets in his car And gets right on the phone Backing up, shaking his head saying  \"Let me get my crazy ass home\" And his wife picks up and says \"Darlin' where have you been,  i've been worried about you\" And he says \"Police business, honey, I can't wait  to tell you what I've been going through\" She says \"Are you okay?\" \"Yes\" \"Do you need anything?\" \"No\" \"Well, I baked you a pie\" \"Mmm\" \"Your favorite: Cherry\" Then he said \"I'll be there soon. Sorry I kept you hanging\" Then she said, \"Honey, don't worry about it Just take your time, I still got some cleanin'\" Now meanwhile Misses Roseys back at Gwen's house Tellin it all She said \"I knew there was something about that policeman I started to cut lose my dog\" Gwendolyn looks at her and laughs and says  \"Miss Rosey you are nuts\" And i say \"all I wanted to know  was what was you gonna do with that spatula\" And then we all laughed Tron says \"shes a G no doubt\" Now lets head right back on over To the policeman's house He pulls up in the garage She doesn't expect for him to come that soon She rushed to the door  kisses him on the cheek and says \"I was in the restroom\" Then he said \"Whatcha say that for?\" And then she says \"I don't know\" Then he step back, look at her and says  \"Whatcha all jittery for?\" Then she says \"Sweetheart, maybe it's that time of the month\" Then he says \"Maybe? Maybe that time of the month?\" And then shes says \"You know what I mean\" He says \"I know what came out yo mouth\" He said that \"you said maybe Then she says baby,\" he walks in the house She tries to lead him upstairs  But he goes straight to the kitchen She says \"Hun, I bought you some pears\" And then he said \"I'ma heat this chicken\" Then she turns around thinking to herself With this weird look on her face Then he screams \"Woman, what wrong witchu,  why are you walking back and forth, pacing?\" Before she answers she's thinkin' to herself \"What am I to say?\"  Because the truth of the matter is  that she just slept with another man today And he started calling her name \"Bridget, I know you her me\" But she can't turn around Because the truth on her face He will see it Then he screams \"Bridget\" \"Yes\"\"Look at me\" Bridget turns around and then he says \"Whatcha got up your sleeve?\" She's scared out of her mind Stuttering and shaking and  still talking about some pears He starts screaming saying  \"Woman Im not going up no stairs\" Now he's got a funny feeling Something just don't seem right He's looking at her while she's backing up Then he says \"With all my might, Woman, I swear I'll shoot somebody  if you been doing wrong\" But little does he know  somebody is still right there in his home&lt;","He looks around the kitchen, and says 'something is really weird', She says 'why do you say that?' He says 'cos you keep tryin' to get me outta here', He says 'ever since I been in this house your face has went from white to red and remember when I first walked through the door you acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead'  Then he says 'girl if you hidin' something i'm gonna be so mad', then he hears something fallin he says ' what the fuck was that?' She says ' it sound like it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing', He said 'woman that sound did not come from upstairs, i'll be damned if you're not up to something,  The sound that i just heard, it came from this kitchen, and then he looks over by the stove while shes easin' over by the dishes. and then he walks over to the refridgerator and pushes it back, and then he looks in her face, looks like shes about to have a heart-attack, then he notices the pie on the counter One slice is missing, now the stories gettin' scary, cos he comes to realise that Bridget is allergic to cherry.  Then he slowly looks up at her and now her face is red as hell, he's breathing real hard, movin' closer, she says 'hon you don't look so well' And then he says move She says no He says move She says no BITCH MOVE!!! she moves, and then, he looks at the cabinet, he walks to the cabinet, he's close to the cabinet, now he's opening the cabinet. Now pause the movie cos what i'm about to say to ya'll is so damn twisted, Not only is there a man in his cabinet, but the man... is a MIDGET!&lt;","Oooooooooo Weee!

look On the floor felt on the backseat See I was drinking while I was driving Never thinking bout what I was doing I turned around and before i knew it Here comes this truck now  Doctor said don't think he gonna make it Family said make the funeral arrangements Unplug the machine he's gone now  Then told my wife to be strong now Then a small voice said told me If you promise to stop drinking I surrendered on that day Now for ten years i've been straight  You saved me [4x] Gave me a second chance You saved me [3x] You saved me  Now i've been sitting in this chair Waiting on the phone to ring Praying up to God that someone will call Me with a job opening Cause it's been so hard for me Month to month struggling to eat But still there was no answer I stop believing in his word and Got so mad at him and When somebody said God's good I just laugh at 'em  But in the nick of time his blessing Rain on me By his grace the phone ring A lady said were hiring and  That's when I knew  You saved me [4x]  Now i was 18 out there on the block Selling drugs With a gun at my waist And for people I had no love See the streets was my home Family and friends were all gone Had no one to trust And deep inside i was all alone And a deal went bad one day And it was enough to pause me I was shot 4 times and before i Knew it I was on my knees  Blood pushin out my body My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do I don't think i'm gonna last then I begain to flash back on the things I done in my past Then I heard a small voice that said I'll give you peace if you believe I accepted Christ that day Halilujah now i'm free  You saved me [4x]  I was in the aisle of the grocery store With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering Where did it come from (I got tested) And the results came back  And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer I could not beleive it so  I call my mama to calm my nerves  (mama) she got down on her knees (mama) she said a prayer for me (mama) just keep on thanking Jesus (mama) he'll give you what you need (thank you Jesus) Now that was five years ago I don't have that pain no more Doc said you can go home Cause all your cancer's gone  You saved me [4x]
